  <h2>Hello World</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, how are you feeling about the coding world? My name is Kaylyn Van Norstrand
      and I have little to no experience in this type of field.
      I was previously working as a paralegal for over three years in many different
      firms and it was kind of horrible to the point that I knew I couldn't stay
      in that field for one more day. This is my story of starting with no expierence
      in coding and how I learned while going through the full stack development program
      at Galvanize.</p>
