  <h2>Hello World</h2>
    <p>Hello there, my name is Kaylyn Van Norstrand and I am orignally from Rochester, NY.
      I was previously working as a paralegal for over three years in many different
      firms and I knew it was not what I wanted for a career in the long run.
      I recently left my job in order to start a new career as a full stack developer
      at Galvanize in Denver, Colorado. This is my story of starting with no expierence
      in coding and how I learned while going through the full stack development program
      at Galvanize.</p>
