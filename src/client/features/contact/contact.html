  <h2>About the Author</h2>
  <img src="../assets/FullSizeRender.jpg" class="smallerimg">
  <p>Kaylyn Van Norstrand is originally from New York State where she moved with
    boyfriend, Keith Hopkins(who helped create this site), to Colorado in April 2015.
    Kaylyn had previously graduated with a Masters in Communication and worked a little
    over three years as a paralegal both in NY and CO.</p>
  <p>The reason that Kaylyn moved to Colorado is so that her boyfriend, Keith,
    could attend school at Galvanize. Keith got into the Galvanize program in July
    2015 while Kaylyn got another job as a paralegal. Kaylyn worked at her new paralegal job
    for a few months and was growing extremely unhappy with it. She saw what her
    boyfriend was doing in Galvanize and thought that she could give coding a shot.</p>
  <p>Kaylyn then proceeded to learn basic coding skills from free sites such as
    Free Code Camp, Code School, and Code Academy. Through these courses, she started
    to like all the designing aspects and how challenging the work is. Growing more and
    more unhappy with her paralegal work, Kaylyn took the risk and quit her job to focus on
    coding and with the help of her boyfriend and his teachers, she enrolled in Galvanize.</p>
  <p>Kaylyn started Galvanize in <b>January 2016</b> and is expected to graduate in
    <b>July 2016</b></p>
